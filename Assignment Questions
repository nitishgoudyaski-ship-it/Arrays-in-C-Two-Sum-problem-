Assignment Questions

How long did you spend on this assignment?
I have spent an 1.5 hours and includes in writing, testing, and editing my code in the GitHub.

Based on your effort, what letter grade would you say you earned?
I would give myself an A for effort, as I tried a number of solutions (brute force and optimized hash map solution) before settling.

What letter grade do you deserve on your solution?
I deserve an A because the program compiles, runs, and produces the correct output for all test cases, including edge cases.

Write a summary of what doesn't work in your solution, including a description of how you attempted to solve the problem and where you believe you had problems.
Initially, I solved it using a brute force approach with two nested loops, which was O(n) in time complexity. It was working but not efficient. 
Then I came to know about hash maps in C++ and used an `unordered_map` to solve my problem, reducing the complexity to O(n).
My ultimate solution is right in all cases. 
All I struggled with was the correct syntax of implementing unordered_map in C++, which I understood after reviewing documentation and examples.
