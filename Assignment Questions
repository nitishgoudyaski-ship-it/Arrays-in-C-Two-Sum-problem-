# Assignment Questions (Reflection)

How long did you spend on this assignment?  
I spent around 1.5 hours, including writing, testing, and reviewing my code.  

Based on your effort, what letter grade would you say you earned?  
I would give myself an A for effort, because I tried multiple approaches (brute force and optimized hash map solution) before finalizing.  

Based on your solution, what letter grade would you say you earned?  
I believe I earned an A, since the program compiles, runs, and produces the correct output for all test cases, including edge cases.  

Provide a summary of what doesn't work in your solution, along with an explanation of how you attempted to solve the problem and where you feel you struggled.  
Initially, I attempted a brute force approach using two nested loops, which had a time complexity of O(nÂ²). It worked but was inefficient. 
After that, I researched hash maps in C++ and rewrote my solution using an `unordered_map`, which reduced the complexity to O(n). 
My final solution works correctly for all cases. The only part I struggled with was remembering the correct syntax for unordered_map in C++, but after reviewing documentation and examples, I solved it.
